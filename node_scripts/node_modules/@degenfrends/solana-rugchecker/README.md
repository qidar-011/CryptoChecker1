SPLRugchecker is a TypeScript class that checks if a Solana token is a potential rug pull. It analyzes the blockchain to check the token's metadata,
top holders and liquidity, and provides methods to calculate a rug score and determine if the token is a potential rug pull.

## Installation

Just install it with npm or yarn or whatever.

```bash
npm install "@degenfrends/solana-rugchecker"
```

## Configuration

To create an instance of `SPLRugchecker`, you need to provide a `RugCheckConfig` object with the `solanaRpcEndpoint` and optional `poolFilePath` or
`poolAddress` property. But if you want to use environment variables for the configuration, that's possible too. You need to download the pool file
from https://api.raydium.io/v2/sdk/liquidity/mainnet.json and set the path of the file in the `poolFilePath` property.

### 1. Configuration without environment variables

```typescript
const rugCheckConfig = {
    solanaRpcEndpoint: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com'
    poolFilePath: './mainnet.json' //optional
    poolAddress: '12345pooladdress' //optional, can't be set with environment variable, since it most likely changes on every check
    heliusApiKey: 'your-api-key' //optional
};
const rugChecker = new SPLRugchecker(rugCheckConfig);
```

### 2. Configuration with environment variables

If you want to configure the rug checker with environment variables, you need to define a `SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT` variable and pass an empty object `{}`
in the constructor. BE AWARE THAT YOU NEED AN RPC ENDPOINT THAT ALLOWS THE `getTokenLargestAccounts` CALL! HELIUS.DEV IS WORKING WITH THE FREE TIER
FOR EXAMPLE!

```bash
SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
```

```typescript
const rugChecker = new SPLRugchecker({});
```

## Usage

### Checking a token

To check a token, call the `check` method with the token's address. This method returns a Promise that resolves to a `RugCheckResult` object. With
this result you can do your own calculations whether a token is a rug pull or not.

```typescript
const result = await rugChecker.check('tokenAddress');
```

### Calculating the rug score

If you don't want to implement your own logic to determine the likelyness of a rug pull, you can calculate the rug score with the `rugScore` method.

```typescript
const score = rugChecker.rugScore(result);
```

### Determining if a token is a potential rug pull

To determine if a `RugCheckResult` indicates a potential rug pull, call the `isRug` method. This is only necessary if you don't want to determine
yourself, if the token is a rug or not based on the `RugCheckResult` object or the `rugScore`method.

## Full example

```typescript
const SPLRugchecker = require('@degenfrends/solana-rugchecker').default;

const rugCheckConfig = {
    solanaRpcEndpoint: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com',
    // If you set this option, you need to provide a downloaded version of this file: https://api.raydium.io/v2/sdk/liquidity/mainnet.json, otherwise the API from geckoterminal.com is used.
    poolFilePath: './mainnet.json',
    // If you set this option, you need to provide the pool address for the token yourself. This might be useful when you build a sniper that is listening on raydium pool creation.
    poolAddress: '97oWtQfbZMdDbn1jdNciDHm2vnPBR8VT3Ns7vSS7i9cm',
    // If you set this option, the metadata checker will try to get the Website and Social Media via Helius if the Metaplex request doesn't return any urls for Twitter, Telegram or the Website.
    heliusApiKey: 'your-helius-key'
};
const rugChecker = new SPLRugchecker(rugCheckConfig);
const result = await rugChecker.check('tokenAddress');
// you can access the detailed results of each check. Log the result to see all information that is returned.
const score = rugChecker.rugScore(result);
const isRug = rugChecker.isRug(result);
```

You can use the checkers indivudually like this, in this example I use the website checker, which is not included in the actual rugchecking logic. But
the whois information can give you additional insights about a website and its owner:

```typescript
const MetadataChecker = require('@degenfrends/solana-rugchecker').MetadataChecker;
const WebsiteChecker = require('@degenfrends/solana-rugchecker').WebsiteChecker;

// get the token metadata first
const metadataChecker = new MetadataChecker({
    solanaRpcEndpoint: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com',
    heliusApiKey: 'your-api-key'
});
const metadataCheckResult = await metadataChecker.check('1234tokenaddress');

// and then get the whois information for further processing
const websiteChecker = new WebsiteChecker();
const websiteCheckResult = await websiteChecker.check(result.metadata.website);
```
